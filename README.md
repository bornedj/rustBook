# Welcome to my Rust Book Repo

## This repo is a collection of projects made while completing The [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book)

### Guessing_Game

This project is a CLI number guessing game. It generates a random number from 1 to 100 (inclusive), and has the user guess until they have correctly guessed the number. The program will tell the user if the number they have provided is greater or less than the hidden random number.

### Variables

Program explores rust compilers rules surrounding variables. Including scope, mutability, and data types.

### Functions

Covers functions, expressions, and statements.

### Ownership

Covers concepts of the stack vs heap in memory allocation and how rust deals with the common pain points of other low-level languages. Covers references and borrowing, and introduces the concept of limetimes. Also covers the slice type.
